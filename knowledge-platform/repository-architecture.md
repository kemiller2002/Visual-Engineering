# Repository Architecture

Generated: 2026-07-22T15:10:59+00:00

## Recommendation

Use a hybrid architecture:

- Concept-first for knowledge relationships
- Project-first for active research programs
- Artifact-type collections for generated indexes and registries
- Generated data layers for search, graph traversal, and website navigation

## Why This Fits The Evidence

The repository has 49 files but already spans multiple projects, document types, and maturity levels. A discipline-first tree would fragment shared concepts. A project-first tree would hide cross-project laws and evidence. An artifact-first tree would optimize storage at the expense of reasoning. A hybrid model keeps canonical concepts stable while allowing projects and derived artifacts to evolve independently.

## Canonical Rules

- Canonical concept pages own definitions and stable identifiers.
- Derived documents never duplicate canonical definitions; they cite them.
- Registries are generated, not edited by hand.
- Historical documents remain preserved under lineage-aware versioning.

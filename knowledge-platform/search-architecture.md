# Search Architecture

## Recommendation

Use hybrid retrieval:

- Metadata filters for precision
- BM25 or equivalent lexical search for exact terminology
- Embedding search for semantic recall
- Graph traversal for concept-aware expansion and citation paths

## Retrieval Stack

1. Normalize metadata and chunk canonical summaries plus section-level document chunks.
2. Build a lexical index over full text, titles, headings, IDs, and concept labels.
3. Build a vector index over canonical summaries and semantically chunked sections.
4. Build a graph index over concepts, documents, evidence, and lineage edges.
5. Fuse results with confidence, authority, and recency weighting.

## Query Modes

- Concept search
- Document search
- Evidence search
- Timeline search
- Relationship search
- Project-scoped search

## Ranking Factors

- Title and heading match
- Canonical status
- Authority score
- Confidence score
- Shared concept count
- Citation and backlink count
- Version freshness without hiding superseded history

## Why Not Single-Mode Search

Lexical search alone misses conceptual paraphrases. Vector search alone hides exact IDs, terminology, and structured filters. Graph traversal alone cannot serve as the first-pass retriever. The repository needs all three because it is a research corpus rather than a simple doc site.

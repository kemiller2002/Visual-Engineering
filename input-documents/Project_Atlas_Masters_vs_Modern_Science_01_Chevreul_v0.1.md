# Masters vs. Modern Science 01: Michel-Eugène Chevreul

## Executive Summary

Michel-Eugène Chevreul correctly recognized one of the most important facts in
color composition:

> The appearance of a color is relational rather than fixed.

His work at the Gobelins tapestry manufactory led him to distinguish defects
in a dye from changes produced by neighboring colors. This was a major
conceptual advance. It redirected attention from the material alone to the
interaction among material, arrangement, and perception.

Modern science strongly supports the broad relational insight. A target color
can change in apparent hue, lightness, chroma, or saturation when its surround
changes. Adaptation and local contrast are central components of contemporary
color-appearance research.

Chevreul's stronger formulation, however, is too simple to serve as a universal
law. Neighboring color does not always force the target directly toward the
neighbor's complement. Depending on spatial scale, contour, texture, temporal
presentation, luminance structure, and distribution of surround colors, the
target may show:

- contrast, shifting away from the surround
- assimilation, shifting toward the surround
- little measurable induction
- a mixture of local and global effects
- changes not well predicted by a single homogeneous-surround rule

Chevreul therefore belongs in Atlas as an unusually strong observational
theorist whose central discovery remains valid, but whose single-law
explanation should be replaced by a conditional family of mechanisms.

---

# 1. Why Chevreul Matters

Chevreul did not begin with an abstract color wheel. He began with a production
failure.

Customers and craftspeople complained that colors in Gobelins tapestries,
including blacks and grays, appeared weak, impure, or incorrectly dyed.
Chevreul investigated whether the chemical dyes were defective. In many cases,
the material itself was not the problem. The apparent defect emerged after the
thread was placed beside other colors.

This distinction is foundational:

```text
Material defect ≠ perceptual interaction
```

Chevreul recognized that quality control could fail when observers attributed
a contextual appearance shift to the object itself.

That problem remains current in:

- interface tokens
- paint selection
- textile manufacturing
- printing
- photography
- architectural finishes
- data visualization
- brand color systems
- display calibration

A color that appears correct in isolation may appear wrong in composition.

---

# 2. Chevreul's Core Claims

Chevreul's work is broad and historically layered. Later teaching often reduces
it to one slogan. Atlas should separate several claims.

## CHV-CLM-001 — Colors change one another in juxtaposition

### Claim

Two nearby colors may appear different from how they appear separately.

### Modern status

**Strongly supported**

### Atlas interpretation

This is the durable center of Chevreul's work.

---

## CHV-CLM-002 — Difference is perceptually exaggerated

### Claim

When two colors are compared simultaneously, their differences tend to appear
greater.

This includes differences in:

- hue
- lightness or darkness
- intensity

### Modern status

**Supported under important conditions, but not universal**

### Atlas interpretation

Contrast induction, crispening, and gamut-expansion phenomena support
difference enhancement. However, assimilation can produce the opposite effect.

---

## CHV-CLM-003 — Each color shifts toward the complement of its neighbor

### Claim

A color appears as though some of the neighbor's complementary color were
mixed into it.

### Modern status

**Useful approximation for some contrast conditions; inadequate as a general
mechanism**

### Atlas interpretation

Modern opponent and appearance models can predict shifts away from the
surround, but the direction and magnitude depend on more than complementary
hue geometry.

---

## CHV-CLM-004 — Light-dark contrast is part of simultaneous contrast

### Claim

Juxtaposed colors alter one another not only chromatically but also in apparent
lightness.

### Modern status

**Supported**

### Atlas interpretation

Chevreul was right not to isolate hue from value. Modern research similarly
separates and jointly studies luminance, chromaticity, and appearance.

---

## CHV-CLM-005 — Practical harmony can be engineered by controlling adjacency

### Claim

Artists, textile designers, decorators, architects, mapmakers, and others can
predictably improve combinations through awareness of contrast effects.

### Modern status

**Partly supported, but “harmony” requires more variables than adjacency**

### Atlas interpretation

Adjacency is a major compositional variable. It is not a complete model of
harmony, preference, legibility, or meaning.

---

## CHV-CLM-006 — Color judgment should occur in intended context

### Claim

The result should be evaluated as a combination rather than inferred from
isolated material samples.

### Modern status

**Strongly supported**

### Atlas interpretation

This is one of Chevreul's most practically important principles.

---

# 3. Modern Scientific Translation

Chevreul used the vocabulary available in the nineteenth century. Modern
science separates his observation into several phenomena.

## 3.1 Chromatic induction

A surround changes the apparent color of a target.

This is the broad category.

## 3.2 Simultaneous contrast

The target shifts away from the surround along one or more perceptual
dimensions.

## 3.3 Assimilation

The target shifts toward the surround.

## 3.4 Crispening

Differences near a surrounding or reference color may become more perceptually
distinct.

## 3.5 Gamut expansion

A set of colors may appear to span a larger perceptual range under some
surround conditions.

## 3.6 Chromatic adaptation

The visual system changes its response according to the prevailing
illumination or color distribution.

## 3.7 Color constancy

The visual system partially stabilizes perceived surface color despite changes
in illumination.

Chevreul grouped multiple outcomes under contrast. Modern research indicates
that these outcomes should be modeled separately and then recombined.

# 4. Evidence Comparison

## CHV-EVD-001 — Original contextual observation

### Source

Michel-Eugène Chevreul, *The Laws of Contrast of Colour* and the original 1839
French edition.

### Chevreul's contribution

Chevreul distinguishes the physical composition of colored material from its
appearance in relation to surrounding colors.

### Modern interpretation

This is an early practical account of contextual color appearance.

### Evidence grade

**D as historical observational evidence**

### Confidence

High that the observation is genuine and important. Lower confidence in the
precision of the original explanatory law.

---

## CHV-EVD-002 — Simultaneous contrast conflicts with simple traditional laws

### Source

Ekroll et al., “Basic Characteristics of Simultaneous Color Contrast
Revisited.”

### Finding

The researchers presented evidence linking simultaneous color contrast with
crispening and gamut expansion. They concluded that basic characteristics of
the phenomenon conflict with traditional laws.

### Implication

Chevreul's general observation survives, while the traditional one-direction
law does not fully explain the data.

### Supports

- CHV-LAW-001
- CHV-LAW-002
- CHV-LAW-003

### Confidence

Moderate to high

---

## CHV-EVD-003 — Surround variance matters, not only average surround color

### Source

Brown and MacLeod, “Color Appearance Depends on the Variance of Surround
Colors.”

### Finding

Color appearance depended on the distribution of colors around the target, not
only the surround's mean color.

### Implication

A single neighboring or equivalent-surround value is insufficient for complex
compositions.

Two compositions can have the same average surround but produce different
appearance because their distributions differ.

### Supports

- CHV-LAW-002
- CHV-LAW-004

### Confidence

High within the experimental conditions

---

## CHV-EVD-004 — Appearance models need contrast adaptation

### Source

Smet et al., “Color Appearance Model Incorporating Contrast Adaptation.”

### Finding

Conventional color appearance models primarily include chromatic adaptation,
while spatial contrast effects require additional modeling. The proposed work
incorporates contrast adaptation into appearance prediction.

### Implication

Even sophisticated appearance models do not automatically capture the full
Chevreul problem.

### Supports

- CHV-LAW-001
- CHV-LAW-005

### Confidence

Moderate

---

## CHV-EVD-005 — Spatial extent changes induction

### Source

Kanematsu et al., “Influence of Stimulus Size on Simultaneous Chromatic
Induction.”

### Finding

The magnitude and direction of chromatic induction depended on center-line
width and the presence or absence of a white contour. The study observed
conditions associated with contrast and assimilation.

### Implication

There is no context-free “neighboring colors” rule. Geometry and contour
participate in the effect.

### Supports

- CHV-LAW-002
- CHV-LAW-003
- CHV-LAW-006

### Confidence

Moderate

---

## CHV-EVD-006 — CIE appearance models are viewing-condition specific

### Source

CIECAM16.

### Finding

Color appearance correlates are computed from tristimulus values together with
viewing-condition parameters.

### Implication

Modern color science formally accepts Chevreul's broad proposition that
appearance cannot be inferred from object color alone.

### Supports

- CHV-LAW-001
- CHV-LAW-005

### Confidence

High

---

## CHV-EVD-007 — Direct contrast effects remain an active modeling problem

### Source

CIE conference work on integrating simultaneous contrast into color appearance
models.

### Finding

Researchers continue to test modifications that incorporate simultaneous
contrast, especially for self-luminous displays.

### Implication

Chevreul identified a real problem that remains incompletely represented by
general-purpose color appearance models.

### Confidence

Moderate

---

## CHV-EVD-008 — Critical historical reassessment

### Source

“Michel-Eugène Chevreul and the Phenomenology of Color,” *Perspectives on
Science* (2025).

### Finding

The paper argues that Chevreul's treatise should not be treated as empirical
science by modern standards despite its reputation and practical importance.

### Implication

Atlas should distinguish:

- observational value
- practical usefulness
- historical influence
- experimental rigor
- causal validity

Chevreul can be highly valuable without being retroactively classified as a
modern experimental scientist.

### Confidence

Moderate, pending full-text methodological review

# 6. What Chevreul Got Right

## 6.1 Color is relational

This is the central success.

Color appearance is not fully contained in the stimulus.

## 6.2 Perceptual failure can masquerade as material failure

A dye, paint, screen value, or printed ink may be physically correct yet appear
incorrect in context.

## 6.3 Composition changes the unit of analysis

The isolated swatch is not always the appropriate unit. The operative unit may
be:

- color plus surround
- color plus contour
- color plus pattern
- color plus material
- color plus illumination
- color plus sequence

## 6.4 Lightness and chromatic effects interact

Chevreul did not reduce all color interaction to hue.

## 6.5 Practical observation can precede scientific mechanism

Chevreul's work demonstrates that production problems can reveal stable
perceptual phenomena before the underlying mechanism is known.

---

# 7. What Requires Revision

## 7.1 Complementarity is not a universal vector

The perceived shift cannot always be predicted by adding the simple
color-wheel complement of the neighbor.

A modern account must specify:

- perceptual color space
- target and surround coordinates
- luminance relation
- adaptation state
- spatial frequency
- area
- contour
- duration
- observer
- task

## 7.2 Contrast is not the only outcome

Assimilation is not an exception that can be ignored. It is evidence that
spatial integration and segregation compete.

## 7.3 “Two colors” is often too small a model

Complex surrounds have variance, texture, pattern, and multiple regions.
Their effects are not reducible to one average neighboring color.

## 7.4 Harmony is not identical to perceptual separation

Strong contrast may increase visibility but reduce calmness, unity, or
semantic appropriateness. Harmony and discrimination are different dependent
variables.

## 7.5 Observation is not yet measurement

Chevreul's practical demonstrations are valuable, but Atlas must not infer
effect magnitude, universality, or mechanism without controlled evidence.

---

# 8. Hidden Implications for Project Atlas

## 8.1 Color tokens need relational metadata

A token such as:

```yaml
brand-red: "#D9232E"
```

is radically incomplete.

A stronger representation is:

```yaml
token_id: brand-red
encoded_value:
  space: oklch
  value: [0.58, 0.22, 25]
intended_roles:
  - accent
  - error
validated_contexts:
  - background: surface-light
    text_size: large
    outcome: pass
  - background: surface-dark
    outcome: appearance-shift-observed
prohibited_contexts:
  - adjacent_to: warning-orange
viewing_assumptions:
  medium: emissive-display
  adaptation: mixed
```

The precise schema remains open, but the principle is clear: a useful design
token must store relationships and validated uses, not merely a coordinate.

## 8.2 Palette testing should use contextual arrays

A palette should be tested in:

- isolated swatches
- pairwise adjacency
- representative component layouts
- low and high area ratios
- light and dark surrounds
- repeated and rare usage
- grayscale
- color-vision-deficiency simulations
- expected display and material conditions

## 8.3 Design-system defects may be perceptual, not numerical

When a team says a token is “wrong,” Atlas should distinguish:

1. encoded-value error
2. rendering error
3. illumination or display error
4. contextual induction
5. semantic mismatch
6. hierarchy conflict
7. adaptation or repetition effect

## 8.4 Context must be represented as a field

Chevreul is commonly reduced to adjacent pairs. Modern evidence suggests a
larger field model:

```text
Target Appearance =
  f(target,
    immediate boundary,
    local surround,
    surround distribution,
    global field,
    adaptation history,
    geometry,
    task)
```

## 8.5 “Contrast” needs directional and functional labels

Atlas should replace vague statements such as:

> Increase the contrast.

With statements such as:

> Increase target-background lightness difference to improve text
> discrimination.

or:

> Increase chromatic separation from competing status colors while preserving
> equal lightness.

or:

> Reduce local hue contrast to improve field unity without weakening structural
> boundaries.

# 9. Candidate Laws

## CHV-LAW-001 — Law of Relational Color Appearance

### Hypothesis

The perceived appearance of a color is a function of the target and its spatial,
temporal, and adaptation context.

### Prediction

Holding the target stimulus constant while changing the surrounding field will
produce systematic appearance changes.

### Evidence

- CHV-EVD-001
- CHV-EVD-003
- CHV-EVD-004
- CHV-EVD-006

### Confidence

High

---

## CHV-LAW-002 — Law of Conditional Induction Direction

### Hypothesis

Contextual color induction may produce contrast, assimilation, or negligible
change depending on spatial and temporal organization.

### Prediction

Changing contour, scale, spatial frequency, or exposure duration while holding
target and nominal surround colors constant can reverse or weaken the direction
of induction.

### Evidence

- CHV-EVD-002
- CHV-EVD-005

### Confidence

High for conditionality; moderate for any general predictive model

---

## CHV-LAW-003 — Law of Segregation-Integration Competition

### Hypothesis

Contrast is favored when target and surround are perceptually segregated,
whereas assimilation becomes more likely when spatial organization promotes
integration.

### Prediction

Conditions that strengthen common texture, fine-scale interleaving, or weak
boundary separation will increase assimilation relative to contrast.

### Evidence

- CHV-EVD-005
- Broader chromatic-induction literature

### Confidence

Moderate

---

## CHV-LAW-004 — Law of Surround Distribution

### Hypothesis

Target appearance depends on the statistical distribution of surrounding
colors, not only their mean.

### Prediction

Surrounds with equal mean chromaticity but different variance or arrangement
will produce different target appearances.

### Evidence

- CHV-EVD-003

### Confidence

High within tested conditions

---

## CHV-LAW-005 — Law of Context-Bounded Color Specification

### Hypothesis

A color specification is valid only within a bounded set of viewing,
rendering, and compositional conditions.

### Prediction

A token validated in isolation or on one background will not reliably preserve
appearance or function across substantially different contexts.

### Evidence

- CHV-EVD-001
- CHV-EVD-004
- CHV-EVD-006
- CHV-EVD-007

### Confidence

High

---

## CHV-LAW-006 — Law of Boundary-Mediated Color Interaction

### Hypothesis

The strength and direction of contextual color effects depend partly on the
boundary separating target from surround.

### Prediction

Adding, removing, or changing a contour can alter the magnitude or direction
of induction without changing target or surround chromaticities.

### Evidence

- CHV-EVD-005

### Confidence

Moderate

---

## CHV-LAW-007 — Law of Perceptual Quality Attribution

### Hypothesis

Observers may attribute a context-induced appearance change to the material or
token itself unless context is explicitly controlled or compared.

### Prediction

Quality judgments made from only the final composition will produce false
material-defect reports that decline when the target is compared across
controlled surrounds.

### Evidence

- Chevreul's Gobelins production problem
- Modern contextual appearance evidence

### Confidence

Moderate to high

# 10. Practical Tests Derived from Chevreul

## CHV-TST-001 — Context Swap Test

Place the same target color on:

- a lighter neutral
- a darker neutral
- a warm chromatic surround
- a cool chromatic surround
- a low-variance surround
- a high-variance surround

Record perceived:

- lightness
- hue
- chroma
- prominence
- readability
- semantic fit

## CHV-TST-002 — Boundary Test

Hold target and surround values constant while changing:

- no contour
- white contour
- dark contour
- wide contour
- thin contour

## CHV-TST-003 — Scale Test

Repeat the same relationship at:

- icon scale
- text scale
- component scale
- page-field scale
- architectural sample scale

## CHV-TST-004 — Distribution Test

Create surrounds with the same average color but different:

- variance
- clustering
- pattern frequency
- area ratios

## CHV-TST-005 — Attribution Test

Ask observers whether the target itself changed before revealing that its
encoded value remained constant.

This measures false attribution of contextual effects to the object.

# 12. Research Questions Opened by Chevreul

1. Can contrast and assimilation be predicted from one spatial model?
2. Which boundary properties determine whether regions segregate or integrate?
3. How should surround variance be represented in design-system tooling?
4. At what area ratios does a color stop acting as an accent and become an
   adapting field?
5. How far from a target can a surround continue to alter appearance?
6. How do texture and material alter induction in architecture?
7. Does repeated exposure reduce contextual contrast or merely reduce
   attentional salience?
8. Can the Gobelins quality-control problem be reproduced with digital design
   tokens?
9. Which color appearance models are useful for complex interfaces rather than
   isolated patches?
10. How should Atlas distinguish measured appearance change from semantic or
    emotional reinterpretation?

---

# 13. Atlas Verdict

Chevreul's central contribution should be retained as a foundational law:

> A color cannot be specified, judged, or designed independently of the field
> in which it appears.

But the traditional law of simultaneous contrast should be revised:

> Surrounding colors alter target appearance through context-sensitive
> mechanisms that may increase difference, increase similarity, or produce
> little change depending on spatial organization, adaptation, and viewing
> conditions.

Chevreul did not deliver the final theory. He found the correct problem.

That distinction matters. His greatest contribution was not identifying a
universal complementary shift. It was proving, through a practical production
failure, that the object is not always where the apparent defect resides.

---

# Next Step

The next document in the series should examine **Josef Albers**.

Albers is the logical successor because he transformed color relativity from a
production diagnosis into a systematic educational practice. The comparison
should determine whether his exercises reveal distinct mechanisms or different
demonstrations of the same contextual system identified by Chevreul.
